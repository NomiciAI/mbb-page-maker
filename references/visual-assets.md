# Visual Asset Guidance

Use visual assets to clarify a page message, improve visual balance, or create a purposeful cover/section moment. Do not use them to decorate weak content or hide missing evidence.

## Default Policy

- Prefer repo-native CSS/SVG primitives for interior pages.
- Use generated bitmap assets mainly for cover, hero, and high-emphasis section pages.
- Treat visual primitives and generated images as support, not evidence. They must not be used as body-slide filler or as a substitute for a real component.
- If removing the visual does not weaken the page argument, remove it and use the space for evidence, implication, or a cleaner layout.
- Do not bundle third-party original images unless the user explicitly approves a reviewed CC0/public-domain asset.
- Network images may be used only as reference, seed, or mood input. Final bundled assets must be strongly transformed, self-generated, and free of recognizable brands, people, trademarks, product UI, buildings, logos, source marks, and consulting-firm cues.
- Do not copy composition, color system, labels, logos, footers, confidentiality text, or proprietary visual treatment from reference decks.

## Visual Roles

| Role | Use when | Preferred asset type | Do not use when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cover / hero | Opening or section page needs an executive visual signal and text-safe negative space. | Generated bitmap or `.cover-art` image. | The visual would make title text hard to read or add generic decoration. |
| Section divider | A longer deck needs pacing between chapters. | CSS line fields, abstract cover art, or a sparse visual primitive. | Short evidence-driven decks; use a data-bearing section intro instead. |
| Concept support | A qualitative page has one governing concept that benefits from a visual metaphor. | `framework-map`, `outcome-support`, `callout`, or a CSS/SVG primitive paired with explanation. | The visual only decorates a weak or generic page. |
| Architecture / system | The page explains layers, platforms, integration, or control planes. | `framework-map`, process components, real architecture diagram, or only then `visual-architecture-stack`. | Exact technical architecture is required; use a real architecture diagram instead. |
| Market / portfolio | The page frames opportunity spaces, growth lanes, or option terrain. | `portfolio-prioritization-matrix`, `weighted-scorecard`, `comparison-table`, or only then `visual-market-map`. | The source has scored options; use portfolio or scorecard components. |
| Value bridge | The page explains movement from baseline to upside or decision value. | `sensitivity-grid`, `waterfall`, chart/table, or only then `visual-value-bridge`. | Exact financial values are available; use a chart or sensitivity grid. |
| Risk / control | The page frames safeguards, boundaries, or escalation logic. | `risk-matrix-register`, `status-table`, `decision-flowchart`, or only then `visual-risk-control`. | Risk names, owners, and mitigations are explicit; use risk/status components. |
| Journey / adoption | The page explains user, customer, or operating progression. | `journey-arc`, `journey-wave`, `timeline`, or only then `visual-customer-journey`. | Dates or workstreams matter more; use time components. |
| Team / network | The page explains collaboration, ownership, or enablement. | `contact-card`, roster layouts, `raci-governance-grid`, or only then `visual-team-network`. | Named people/contact records are present; use people or governance components. |
| Data flywheel | The page explains learning loops, telemetry, or compounding knowledge assets. | `cycle-flow`, `process-flow`, metrics/table, or only then `visual-data-flywheel`. | The page needs real metric proof; use data components. |

## Authoring Rules

- Data-rich pages should use charts, tables, matrices, scorecards, metrics, or risk/status components before visual primitives.
- A visual page still needs an answer-first title. The visual supports the claim; it is not the claim.
- A body slide with a visual primitive must also have a real component or explicit explanatory structure. Visual-only body slides fail the quality gate unless deliberately marked `data-allow-visual="true"` for a showcase or section moment.
- Do not place fake platform, orbit, stack, map, or abstract system visuals in content pages when a framework, table, scorecard, roadmap, risk register, or process component would communicate the point more clearly.
- Keep visuals inside safe slots: `.content`, `.region-body`, `.safe-fill`, `.safe-stack`, `.cover-art`, or `.cover-visual-slot`.
- Use `.content.is-vertically-centered` when a single visual primitive is compact and would otherwise sit at the top.
- Dark pages must use dark slide tokens and pass `scripts/check-deck-contrast.sh`.
- If the visual requires real-world specificity, use user-supplied media or approved external research. Do not invent company/product screenshots.

## Bitmap Asset Rules

- Bundled generated bitmap assets live under `assets/media/covers/` or `assets/media/illustrations/`.
- Each bitmap must be listed in a manifest with file name, role, use case, generation mode, inspiration URLs, license notes, generated date, and prompt summary.
- New cover/hero assets should generally stay below 350KB each unless the user explicitly prioritizes image fidelity.
- Avoid visible text inside generated images. Deck text belongs in HTML for accessibility, contrast checks, and editing.

## Web Inspiration Gate

Before using a network asset as inspiration, record:

- asset URL
- license page URL
- access date
- whether the original file enters the repo
- transformation approach
- risk notes for people, brands, trademarks, product UI, buildings, or source marks

Default answer for "original file enters the repo" is `no`.
