# MBB Page Maker

This is a world-class AgentSkill for creating consulting-style HTML PPT decks: strategy pages, board updates, investment memos, and executive narratives.

The goal is to give any capable agent a reliable, installable way to author, preview, and eventually export executive-grade HTML presentations from a static skill package.

This repo is currently in the foundational HTML skeleton phase.

Design constraints:

- One-command install.
- No build step.
- Pure static HTML/CSS/JS.
- CDN webfonts only.
- Export targets: HTML first, then PNG/PDF, PowerPoint later.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/NomiciAI/mbb-page-maker
```

Repository: [NomiciAI/mbb-page-maker](https://github.com/NomiciAI/mbb-page-maker)

The repository can stay private during development. When it is public, the command above can install the AgentSkill directly from GitHub.

## Roadmap

1. Finalize the foundational HTML PPT shell and shared primitives.
2. Add case-by-case reference guidance after approved examples are selected.
3. Add PNG/PDF export.
4. Research PowerPoint export.

## Design System

CSS is intentionally split by responsibility:

- `base.css`: canvas, typography primitives, runtime controls, print rules.
- `layouts.css`: page-level layout shells.
- `components.css`: tables, cards, metrics, agenda, matrix, roadmap, profile blocks.
- `illustrations.css`: neutral illustration primitives and asset slots.
- `themes/*.css`: color tokens only, with light and dark mode values.
- `assets/media/`: optional static images, SVGs, screenshots, and showcase-only filler headshots.

The base layout and component library is structure-first. Themes, showcase pages, or deliberate variants should carry color, image treatment, and decorative effects.

Authoring is composable:

1. Choose a skeleton: neutral, light, dark, or mixed.
2. Choose a layout from `templates/layouts/`.
3. Fill it with components from `templates/components/`.
4. Apply one theme from `assets/themes/`.

Default simple pages are included for opening, centered message/list/metric, visual title, and ending slides. Use `blank-*` layouts when the slide structure is known but the component choice is still being composed.
